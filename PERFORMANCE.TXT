	   Some performance data using the nec2d960 and nec2dXS1k5.exe:

	   test A) Single-run test: Using 4x20ra.nec and requesting a far-field pattern 
		   with 5 degree resolution
	   test B) Optimization test: Using 36dip.nec and performing a (traditional/hill-
		   climbing)
	
	   Optimization is performed on "X-a" to resonate the antenna by selecting the 
	   wire length "len" as variable to change, starting with 18.4 m (optimized in 
	   27 steps, resulting in a length of 19.65 m)
